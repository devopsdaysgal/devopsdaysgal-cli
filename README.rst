This is a simple CLI with a collection of commands that is used by
the organizers of Devopsdays Galway to interact with the various tools
used to simplify many of the common actions performed and ensure
consistency and avoid siloing of knowledge around how specific setup
actions.

It may or may not be useful for others to consider using.
